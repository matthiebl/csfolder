# CSFolder
A silly script to run through folder generation

### Usage
You can simply run the script to use it, or alternatively add an alias to your terminal.

Adding the following line to your `.bashrc` file and reloading your terminal should get it working.

```bash
alias csfolder='[path/to/file]/csfolder.py'
```

Personally I have the file located at `~/` and renamed to `.csfolder.py`, so the alias I use is

```bash
alias csfolder='~/.csfolder'
```
